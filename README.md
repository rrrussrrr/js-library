A basic library application to add and display book information.  Input title, author, number of pages and the page stores all information in localStorage.  You can toggle the Read status of each book, as well as delete books.

This project is meant to practice using constructors and basic OOP in Javascript. Also utilized a lot of CSS that was new to me including use of modal popups.

ToDo:
Edit book function
Further refine styling
Search function?
